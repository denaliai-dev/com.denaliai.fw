	ExceptionReporter
		We should record details that are useful in writing exception logs to disk
		Record request data that started the current Operation
		Record data pulled from remote sources (like dbs and whatnot)
		On an exception, we can flush the exception and all details to disk (like a crash report)
		This should be self-limiting so we don't run a machine out of disk space
